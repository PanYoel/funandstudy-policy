  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p class="meta"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 25, 2025</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <p>
    We do not collect any personal information that could directly identify you.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Hero Hunmin: Learn English</em> does not ask for or collect your name,
    phone number, home address, or other personally identifiable information.
    We also do not access sensitive device data such as precise GPS location,
    photos, microphone audio, or contacts.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, the app may generate and process non-personal data related to
    gameplay and learning activity (for example, levels completed, scores,
    and learning achievements). This information is not linked to any
    real-world identity and is handled in an anonymized or aggregated form.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also provide optional online features such as cloud backup,
    leaderboard, and account sync across devices.
    If you choose to sign in using an email and password, we will process that
    login credential only for the purpose of creating and maintaining your game
    account and enabling cloud save features. We do not ask for or store any
    additional profile details (such as real name, age, or address).
  </p>

  <p>
    Some technical information (for example, device model, game version,
    general usage patterns, crash information) may be generated by the app
    or by service providers in order to operate the service,
    improve stability, and prevent abuse.
    This data is not used to personally identify you.
  </p>

  <p>
    By default, analytics collection is disabled in the app.
    Analytics is only enabled if (and after) appropriate consent is given.
    When enabled, analytics is limited to anonymous or aggregated usage data
    and does not include personal identifiers.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also do not collect precise location and do not attempt to infer
    your real-world identity from IP address.
  </p>

  <h2>Purpose of Data Collection</h2>

  <h3>Improving gameplay and learning experience</h3>
  <p>
    We may analyze anonymous progress data (for example, success rate,
    difficulty, time spent) to adjust difficulty, tune content,
    or improve learning features.
  </p>

  <h3>App performance, quality, and safety</h3>
  <p>
    We may use technical data (for example, crashes, loading issues,
    cheating/abuse attempts) to detect problems, fix bugs,
    and keep the service stable.
  </p>

  <h3>Cloud features (optional)</h3>
  <p>
    If you sign in and use cloud save, leaderboard, or sync features,
    we use your authenticated account to store and retrieve your save data,
    so that you can access your progress on multiple devices
    and restore it later.
  </p>

  <h3>Advertising</h3>
  <p>
    We show only non-personalized, age-appropriate ads using Unity Ads.
    Personalized / targeted ads are disabled.
    Ads are configured to comply with child-directed requirements.
  </p>

  <p>
    Analytics data (if consented to) may be handled via Firebase Analytics
    in anonymous or aggregated form.
    Advertising may be delivered via Unity Ads.
    If we introduce an additional ad network such as Google AdMob in the future,
    we will continue to require child-appropriate,
    non-personalized ads.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services and Data Sharing</h2>

  <p>
    We do not sell or rent user data.
  </p>

  <p>
    We rely on trusted third-party services to provide core functionality:
  </p>

  <h3>Unity Ads (currently in use)</h3>
  <p>
    We display ads using Unity Ads.
    To deliver non-personalized, age-appropriate ads and to help prevent
    fraud or abuse, Unity may process certain device-level information
    such as advertising identifier, IP address, and basic app/device metadata.
    We configure Unity Ads to request only non-personalized ads that are
    appropriate for all ages. Unity processes this information under its own
    privacy policy.
  </p>

  <h3>Firebase (currently in use)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Authentication:</strong>
      If you create an in-app account with email and password,
      this credential is used only to sign you in and associate your save data
      with your account.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cloud Storage / Database:</strong>
      We store your game save data so you can back it up, restore it,
      or sync it across devices.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Analytics:</strong>
      By default, analytics collection is turned off.
      Anonymous usage analytics may be enabled only after appropriate consent
      (for example, by a parent/guardian or an adult user).
      We do not use analytics data to personally identify any player.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Google AdMob (potential future use)</h3>
  <p>
    We may integrate Google AdMob in the future to serve ads.
    If we do so, we will continue to request only non-personalized,
    age-appropriate ads for child-directed users.
    Before enabling AdMob, we will update this Privacy Policy
    and provide any required links to Google’s policies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each provider only uses data to the extent necessary to deliver its
    specific service for us, and each provider operates under its own
    privacy policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

  <p>
    Our app is available to users of all ages, including children under 13.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information
    from children under 13.
    We do not ask children to enter real names, addresses, phone numbers,
    or other personal contact details.
  </p>

  <p>
    We design the app so that personalized ads and behavioral tracking
    are disabled, and only non-personalized, age-appropriate advertising
    is requested.
    Analytics is disabled by default and may only be enabled with
    appropriate consent.
    We intend to comply with applicable child privacy laws such as
    the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States,
    as well as platform requirements for child-directed apps on Google Play
    and the Apple App Store.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are a parent or guardian and believe that we may have collected
    personal information from your child, please contact us using the email
    below. We will investigate promptly and delete any such information
    if found.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

  <h3>Local game data</h3>
  <p>
    Game progress stored locally on your device (for example, learning progress,
    unlocked content) is removed if you uninstall the app.
  </p>

  <h3>Cloud save data</h3>
  <p>
    If you sign in and choose to upload your save data to our cloud services
    (for example, Firebase Storage / Database), that cloud backup is kept
    so that you can restore it later or sync it on another device.
    This cloud save remains associated with your account until the account
    is deleted. If you request account deletion (or your account is deleted),
    the associated cloud save data will also be deleted.
  </p>

  <h3>Analytics data</h3>
  <p>
    Anonymous analytics data (if enabled with consent) may be retained
    in aggregate form for service improvement and quality monitoring.
    This data is not used to identify individual users.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time
    (for example, if we add a new advertising partner such as Google AdMob,
    or if platform rules change).
    When we update the policy, we will publish the new version in the app
    and/or on the store listing.
    Significant changes will be highlighted.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>

    or about how we handle data, please contact us:
